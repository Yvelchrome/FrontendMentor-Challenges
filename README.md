### What I learned

- In this challenge I learned to create a dropdown navigation menu, I also used the media queries to create a hamburger menu.

- I really feel like I'm getting more and more comfortable at positioning elements and styling them, only the naming is holding me back when it starts to get too complex.

### What I can improve

- I think from now on I will start to work on mobile first, one of the main advantage is that I can get rid of unused CSS code when switching to a mobile device; by doing so I can make the code more readable because I won't have to overwrite or delete the code that already exist for the desktop version; and also more performant because it will have to load less lines of code.
  <br/>
  That is because the smaller is the screen, the less code will be needed because we don't need as much information on the screen; when a solid mobile base will be set, I will then be able to make use of media queries to add new lines of codes, with more details, information, for larger screen sizes.

- I'm still struggling to find a good naming for my elements, as of now, the code is really messy, I know I can improve it, probably merge some elements/classes together to make it more readable and professional. (I planned to do a "big" refactor on this project, since I like doing as good as possible, I will try to make my code as clean as I can with the knowledge I possess ðŸ˜…â€‹)

- I also feel like I tend on this project to rush it and focusing on "making it work" rather than making it clean, like I said above ; the website works well for the width demanded, it looks good, there are no issues, but I can imagine that it would be a pain for someone else to read my codeâ€¦
