### What I learned

In this challenge I mostly learned 3 things.
<br/><br/>
The first thing is the BEM methodology, I find it a very useful, simple naming convention that makes the code easier to read and understand, easier to work with and more explicit.
<br/><br/>
The second thing is the use of SCSS, overall, it made the project so much more enjoyable to make thanks to, for example, the nesting combined with the BEM methodology, the creation of variables, different rules like:

```scss
@import;
@mixin;
@include;
```

to combine multiple stylesheets together...

<br/>
The third thing is the use of the `@media` query, I used it to make the product preview card responsive for both desktop and mobile with a different layout.
